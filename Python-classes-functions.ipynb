    "The fundamental units of modularity in Python are packages, modules, classes, and functions.  Creating packages and modules is outside the scope of this introductory course, but every time you utilize `import foo` or `from foo.bar import baz as bz` you are utilizing those means of packaging related functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you *will* write a lot of, even as a beginner or intermediate Python user, is **functions**.  Classes, in turn, are essentially just ways of bundling together several functions, and often some data those functions use, into the same Python object."

    "## Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is simply a mechanism to encapsulate a number of program steps that you could, in concept, simply write sequentially in a main program.  Most of the time, functions also take a collection of parameters.  These parameters can either be *positional* or *named*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the conceit of the last lesson, let's write a few functions to create ASCII art versions of the Mandelbrot set.  Recall that the Mandelbrot set is defined  in the complex plane as the complex numbers c for which the function $f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c$ does not diverge to infinity when iterated starting at $z=0$. There is a nice property of this iteration that if any iteration of the function has an absolute value greater than 2, we know already that the function (indexed by that complex number) diverges.\n",
    "\n",
    "That may be a mouthful, and the code can make it clearer.  The first step in our approach will be to create a grid of points representing in iteration of the Mandelbrot generating function across a region of the complex plane.  We will use a `list` of `namedtuple` objects in a simlar way as we did with the earlier ASCII art."
