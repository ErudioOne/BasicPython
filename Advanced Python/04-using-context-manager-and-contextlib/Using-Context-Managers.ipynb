    "# Context Managers\n",
    "\n",
    "A context manager, as the name suggests, provides a certain *context* to a series of operations in Python.  Whenever you use the `with` statement in Python, that introduces a context manager.  The idea in a context manager is that some initial setup is performed to prepare for your custom code.  A context object is often provided to your code that incorporates something about that context, and provides a name for you to utilize.  After the block of code nested under `with` complete, some cleanup actions can be performed.  For example, file handles and socket connections can be closed, or configuration settings can be restored to their defaults."

The purpose of these managers is to factor out often used try/finally clauses to make the code more readable.

In fact, `.__enter__()` and `.__exit__()` are often simply synonyms for more conventionally named methods like `.open()` and `.close()`."
