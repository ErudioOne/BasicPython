    "Program execution happens sequentially in Python - the Python interpreter reads a program just like you are reading this paragraph: one line at a time, from left to right and top to bottom. The interpreter executes operations and functions in the order that it encounters them. This is called flow control. \n",
    "\n",
    "Flow control in Python—and in pretty much any imperative programming language—consists of loops and branches.With flow control, you can execute certain code blocks conditionally and/or repeatedly and these basic building blocks can be combined to create sophisticated code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two kinds of loops in Python are `for` and `while`.  Technically Python also allows recursion, which is a kind of looping, but Python is not a language where this is a good general approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Branches have two—or perhaps three—basic forms. Since the beginning of Python in 1991, the structure of `if`, `elif`, and `else` loops was available, and it remains the most common way to express branches or *conditional evaluation*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With Python 3.10 and above, a kind of branching called *structural pattern matching* was introduced.  The `match` and `case` block structure can be extremely powerful, but focus on a different style of branching than `if`/`elif`/`else` provide.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Structural pattern matching is not a replacement for the traditional `if`—and strictly speaking there's nothing you couldn't do either way—but where conditional actions are driven by the *structure* of an object, the newer approach can be very expressive.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a special sense, the `try`/`except`/`else`/`finally` related blocks in Python express branching as well. However, since they only branch when exceptions occur, they are not addressed in this introductory lesson.  Keep them in mind as you use Python more."

Most likely, if you want to represent actual colors, you will want to use a third party ANSCII code generator and/or create the logo as HTML."
